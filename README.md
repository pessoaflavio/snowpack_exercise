Jail populations in most large cities have declined during the past decade, but jail budgets have generally continued to grow because mayors and county executives have not felt public pressure to downsize jail budgets accordingly. What can we learn by looking at this historical data – with a focus on average cost per-person incarcerated and annual jail population.

The visualization below displays the data for both variables; each line represents county data, with a starting coordinate defined by data from 2007, and the endpoint (with the arrowhead) shows how the data moved: the coordinate is data from the same variables, in 2017.
